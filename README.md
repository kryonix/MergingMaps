# MergingMaps

## Abstract
Pictures taken form an airplane or satellite can cover only a small portion of the earth. 
These pictures are often of sufficiently high resolution to uniquely identify major features. 
This information can be used to produce a map of a larger area by taking pictures of smaller *overlapping* areas and merging these.

Traditional brute-force techniques to solve merging maps are time consuming. 
This is an algorithm that uses a greedy heuristic for optimizing the overlay of a *large* number of maps.
